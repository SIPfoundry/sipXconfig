Having a database on each server is an optimal configuration. It ensures redundancy, \
enables load sharing, performs better and often reduces overall network traffic. <br/> \
Understanding these concepts will help you configure your system: <br/> \
<b>PRIMARY</b> - All data originates from the one primary database. If the primary becomes unavailable \
there is a short delay while the cluster selects a new primary database.<br/> \
<b>SECONDARY</b> - All databases that are not a primary database are a secondary database. New data is automatically copied to secondary databases. This allows a \
secondary database to share in read-only operations and to be used as a primary database should the need arise.<br/> \
<b>ARBITER</b> - When a primary becomes unavailable, the remaining databases pass "votes" to each other to select a new primary server. \
There needs to be an odd number of databases to break a tie vote. If your system \
has an even number of databases, you'll want to add exactly one arbiter to break a tie.  If your system has \
an odd number of databases, you'll want no arbiters.<br/> \
<b>Priority</b> - Increase a database's priority value to make the database the preferred primary. The primary role will eventually be \
transferred to the server with the highest priority  when it's convenient to do so based on the rate of data transfer between the databases.<br/> \
<b>Voting</b> - If you do not want a particular database to participate in the voting process, you can disable this feature for each database. \
A cluster is limited to 7 voting servers and 12 database servers in total. <br/>
local.help=If any server is located in a specific office and the network connection from that office to the other servers in your cluster can be broken, \
you can add a local database to that server so that phones can continue to operate within that office.<br/> \
If you have a servers in multiple data centers and network latency between the data centers is larger than 100ms or you have more than 50 phones, \
then might want to consider adding a local database to reduce the chatter between the data centers.<br/>
