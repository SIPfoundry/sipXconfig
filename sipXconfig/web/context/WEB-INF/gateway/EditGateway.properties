   the gateway vendor's  manual or ask an expert for advice if other parameters need to be adjusted.

quick.help.gatewayCallerAlias=<br/>\
    Outbound Caller ID is determined by user Caller ID settings combined with gateway \
	Caller ID settings.\
	<br/>\
	For SIP trunks resulting Caller ID will depend on the ITSP policies.\
	<br/>\
	Analog gateways are typically unable to propagate Caller ID and will show their respective PSTN \
	line number instead.\
	<br/>\
    Behavior of digital (T1/E1) gateways and SIP phones is vendor specific. \
    Effective caller ID may also depend on your carrier.\
    <br/>\
    Advanced settings allow for overriding Display Name, domain name and URL parameters of the caller ID.\
    These options are typically useful only if the gateway routes calls to another SIP system.
