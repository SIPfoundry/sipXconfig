  Call center does not use a single queue, which means there's the question of which queue is serviced. \
  The factors considered are the queue weight, the priority of the first unserviced media in a queue, \
  how long it has been since queue was serviced, and finally how long the media has been in queue. \
  All of this does not mean a higher weighted queue will be serviced first, it means it is more likely to be serviced  first. \
  A queue with a weight of 10 is twice as likely to be selected as a queue with a weight of 5 assuming there are only those 2 queues, \
  and each has a serviceable media in them.
