quick.help.configurebundles=One or more roles can be enabled on each server.<br/>\
  All roles can run on one single server or the different roles can \
  be distributed to several servers forming a cluster.<br/>\
  A high availability configuration can be configured by enabling a redundant SIP router role.<br/>\
  Roles can be moved to dedicated servers to improve performance.

quick.help.natlocation=The following configuration must be applied to the firewall at the network border: <p>\
* Relay messages on the UDP port designated as the "SIP TCP/UDP Port" to the server's private IP address and port 5060<BR> \
* Relay messages on the TCP port designated as the "SIP TCP/UDP Port" to the server's private IP address and port 5060<BR> \
* Relay UDP ports allocated for media relay to the server's private IP address <p><br/>\
<b>WARNING!</b><br/>In case of changing default values for Start / End RTP Port please make sure the specified range \
does not overlap ephemeral port range (usually 32768 to 61000) as this could cause Media Relay to fail.<br/>\
You can check or change ephemeral port range in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range file.
