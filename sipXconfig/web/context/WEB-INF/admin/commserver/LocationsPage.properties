quick.help=<p>Clicking the <em>Send Profiles</em> button will cause configuration files for \
all services to be sent (replicated) to the selected servers, and all affected services to be restarted automatically. \
This is rarely needed as configuration files are sent by default when their \
associated configuration has been changed.  However, in the case where a distributed server \
was not available at the time of a configuration change, this button can be used to re-send \
the configuration.</p>\
<p>Note that <em>sending profiles</em> to the master server will cause the in-memory database (MongoDB) to recreate \
and replicate to all slaves. Sending profiles to a slave server will issue a <em>resync</em> command to the Mongo instance \
running on that server. This will trigger a full replication if and only if that server is lagging behind the master. \
You can use this in order to synchronise a stale slave</p> \
<p>Warning: send profiles operation on a disabled or unregistered node will not be performed.</p>
