quick.help=<p>You can generate CSV file by exporting data from your favorite spreadsheet application. The CSV should have a title line and the following fields\:</p><ul><li>User name</li><li>Voice-mail PIN</li><li>SIP password</li><li>First name</li><li>Last name</li><li>User alias</li><li>EMail Address</li><li>User group</li><li>Phone serial number</li><li>Phone model</li><li>Phone group</li><li>Phone description</li></ul><p>Each line from imported file will result in creation of the phone and the user assigned to that phone. If user group or phone group fields are not empty, the newly created user and phone will be added to respective groups. Groups will be created if they do not exist already. <p><p>If the user with the same username is already present, this system will update existing user instead of creating a new one. The same is true for phones\: if the phone with the same serial number already exist it'll be updated.<br/>Only user name and phone serial number are obligatory fields. You can leave the remaining fields empty - in which case this system will not overwrite their values.</p>
