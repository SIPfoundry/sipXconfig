quick.help.import=Import a certificate based on a CSR  \
					OR a certificate & key generated from a third party authority. Be sure to add authority to \
					'Certificate Authorities' page. \
					<br/><br/>Certificate Signing Request (CSR)<br/><br/> \
					Upon installation of your system a default <em>self-signed</em> certificate was installed \
					to secure Web access. This certificate causes browsers to show a security warning message. If you would like \
					to remove this warning you have to install a trusted certificate available from Certificate Authority \
					such as VeriSign, Entrust, Comodo, GlobalSign etc.<br/>\
					This page allows you to create the necessary Certificate Signing Request (CSR) needed by Certificate Authority \
					and then install the new certificate.<br/>\
					Generate a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) by filling the \
				    fields with the appropriate values and pressing the Generate button. \
				    The content of the CSR file will be visible in the text area.
