audio.system\:network\:dtx_enabled.label=DTX enabled
audio.system\:network\:dtx_enabled.description=When DTX is enabled, transmission to the remote party is suspended when the application detects that the local user is not speaking. \
 true means DTX is enabled; silence is not transmitted. \
 No means silence is transmitted.

diagnostics.system\:diagnostics\:enable_logging.label=Enable logging
diagnostics.system\:diagnostics\:enable_logging.description=Set to true to enable logging

diagnostics.system\:diagnostics\:file_size.label=File size
diagnostics.system\:diagnostics\:file_size.description=The maximum size of the logging file, in kilobytes. Earlier logging records will discarded when the file reaches this size. 0 means no limit. 32768KB is the maximum value.

the application then goes back to the first file, deleting the existing content and writing the new logging information. And then to the second file, and so on.

dtmf.label=DTMF
#dtmf.description=

dtmf.rtp\:2833\:enabled.label=RTP 2833 enabled
dtmf.rtp\:2833\:enabled.description=Set to true to enable local support for RFC 2833 out-of-band DTMF. This setting (a) works with Force send in band (setting (b) as follows\: \
(a) (b) Result \
1 1 Send out-of-band 2833; if that is not acceptable, fall back to in-band. \
1 0 Send out-of-band 2833; if that is not acceptable, fall back to INFO . \
0 1 Send in-band DTMF. \
0 0 Send out-of-band INFO. \
In-band means the application will encode the DTMF signals in the audio stream as regular sound. Typically, DTMF is not sent in band, and is only used in specific situations

dtmf.rtp\:2833\:hold_over_time_in_ms.label=Hold over time
dtmf.rtp\:2833\:hold_over_time_in_ms.description=If Force send in band is No and RTP 2833 enabled is true, specifies the minimum length of time for which to send 2833 packets (in milliseconds). This setting is useful in case the user presses a key really fast, to make sure the packet time is longer than that key press.

dtmf.rtp\:2833\:packet_time_in_ms.label=Packet time
dtmf.rtp\:2833\:packet_time_in_ms.description=If Force send in band is No and RTP 2833 enabled is true, specifies the time between 2833 packets (in milliseconds). During this time, only audio will be sent. This setting is useful if you cannot handled back-to-back 2833 packets.

dtmf.rtp\:2833\:payload_number.label=Payload number
dtmf.rtp\:2833\:payload_number.description=If Force send in band is No, specifies the payload number for DTMF.

dtmf.system\:dtmf\:force_send_in_band.label=Force send in band
dtmf.system\:dtmf\:force_send_in_band.description=Set as described in RTP 2833 enabled. \
One scenario in which it might be advisable to send in band is if you own your gateways, and\: \
- One or more of these gateways does not support 2833 or does not handle it well. \
- Your gateway is using codecs that reproduce DTMF tones well. \
In this case, setting this setting to true will ensure that DTMF tones get through (because the DTMF tones will bypass the gateway) and that they reproduce accurately at the receiving end. \
Another scenario is\: \
- One or more of these gateways does not support 2833 or does not handle it well. \
- Your gateway is using codecs that do not reproduce DTMF tones well (because they are designed to handle human voice rather than artificial sounds). \
In this scenario, setting this setting to true will not help ensure DTMF tones get through. There is in fact no solution to this scenario.

dtmf.system\:dtmf\:minimum_rfc2833_play_time.label=Minimum RFC 2833 play time
dtmf.system\:dtmf\:minimum_rfc2833_play_time.description=If Force send in band is Noe, specify the minimum play duration for DTMF tones.

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtcp_timer_in_ms.label=RTCP timer
network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtcp_timer_in_ms.description=Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the last message received before hanging up on an inactive RTP session. \
This setting is read only when Timer enabled is true and only when the application detects that the other party is sending RTCP reports. (When the application determines that reports are not being sent, it uses RTP timer instead.)

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtp_timer_in_ms.label=RTP timer
network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:rtp_timer_in_ms.description=Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the last message received before hanging up on an inactive RTP session. \
This setting is read only when Timer enabled is true and only when the application detects that the other party is not sending RTCP reports. (When the application determines that reports are being sent, it uses rtcp_timer_in_ms instead.) The default of 0 means that the call is never hung up. Because RTCP reports are not being received, it is difficult to determine whether the call is legitimately inactive (for example, on hold) or whether it has failed and should be hung up, so the default is to never hang up.

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:timer_enabled.label=Timer enabled
network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:timer_enabled.description=Set to true to instruct the application to hangup when it detects that the RTP session is inactive.

network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:timer_in_ms.label=Timer
network.rtp_inactivity.rtp\:inactivity\:timer_in_ms.description=Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after the last message received before hanging up on an inactive RTP session. \

network.sip_signaling.system\:general\:force_calls_on_our_domain.label=Force calls on our domain
network.sip_signaling.system\:general\:force_calls_on_our_domain.description=Set to true to change the domain of an incoming call to the domain of the proxy (account) the call was received on. The domain information is changed only within the application; the original SIP message is not changed. MORE INFO

network.sip_signaling.system\:sip\:re-register_on_network_change.label=Re-register on network changes
network.sip_signaling.system\:sip\:re-register_on_network_change.description=Set to true to instruct the application to reregister with the SIP registrar whenever a network change is detected.

#network.sdp.description=

network.sdp.system\:sdp\:force_include_well_known_rtp_maps.label=Force include well-known RTP maps
network.sdp.system\:sdp\:force_include_well_known_rtp_maps.description=Set to true to instruct the application to transmit a=rtpmap information for all codecs, even the static ones. Set to No to transmit this information only for the dynamic codecs.

network.sdp.rtp\:media\:send_bandwidth_modifier.label=Send bandwidth modifier
network.sdp.rtp\:media\:send_bandwidth_modifier.description=If true, the SDP will include a b-line with content b=AS\:bandwidth in kbps. If No, the SDP will not include a b-line. Set to true if equipment on your network requires this information.

network.stun.label=Firewall Traversal - STUN
#network.stun.description=

network.stun.system\:stun\:fw_type_expiry_in_seconds.label=Firewall type expiry
network.stun.system\:stun\:fw_type_expiry_in_seconds.description=Expiry for the cache of the firewall type (in seconds). The type is cached so that the application does not have to discover the firewall type each time the network is accessed. Caching is performed because firewall type discovery is expensive. \
the application performs a firewall type discovery only when this timeout expires.

network.stun.system\:stun\:initial_retransmit_time_ms.label=Initial retransmit time
network.stun.system\:stun\:initial_retransmit_time_ms.description=The minimum wait time after the first STUN request (in milliseconds). \
If no reply is received to the first STUN request, the application waits this amount of time, then sends another request. If the second request fails, the application waits twice this time and tries again, then four times this time, and so on, until max_retransmit_time_ms is reached. It then continues retrying at the maximum timeout until a reply succeeds or the maximum requests (specified in total_retransmit_packets) is reached.

network.stun.system\:stun\:max_retransmit_time_ms.label=Maximum retransmit time
network.stun.system\:stun\:max_retransmit_time_ms.description=The maximum wait time between STUN requests (in milliseconds). Once this maximum is reached, the application will wait this time for subsequent attempts, until the maximum retries (specified in Total retransmit packets) is reached.

network.stun.system\:stun\:total_retransmit_packets.label=Total retransmit packets
network.stun.system\:stun\:total_retransmit_packets.description=The maximum number of STUN requests that the application sends before giving up.

codecs.label=Codecs

codecs.codecs\:h263\:enable_CIF.description=Set to true to enable CIF resolution, which has a larger frame than QCIF. \
If setting is true and the application computer has a high bandwidth network connection, then the application will choose CIF resolution. \
If this setting is true and the computer has a low bandwidth connection, then the application will probably choose QCIF.

codecs.system\:network\:honor_first_codec.label=Honor first codec
codecs.system\:network\:honor_first_codec.description=Controls the codec the application will use for outgoing audio or video (audio or video being sent to the other party). \
- Set to true to instruct the application to respect the other party's preferred codec (as advertised in their SDP). \
- Set to false to instruct the application to ignore the other party's preferred codec (as advertised in their SDP), and to send audio or video in the codec that sounds best, based on the other party's capability, the available bandwidth, and network conditions.

codecs.codecs\:codec_selection_manager\:enable.label=Mid-call codec optimizing
codecs.codecs\:codec_selection_manager\:enable.description=Controls whether or not the automatic codec selection manager is enabled. The manager uses RTCP statistics feedback to determine whether it should switch to a more appropriate codec mid-call. Most hard-phones and gateways cannot handle mid-call codec changes, so it is typically best to leave this feature disabled.

qos.label=QoS
#qos.description=

qos.system\:qos\:audio.label=Audio
qos.system\:qos\:audio.description=Specifies the type of QOS supported for audio, and if so, whether bandwidth is to be reserved. Bandwidth can be reserved only if the application is runing in Windows on an Intel Centrino Duo mobile-technology-based laptop. \
For example "tos 22 reserved" (type of QOS is tos 22 and bandwidth is reserved) or "tos 22" (type of QOS is tos 22 and bandwidth is not reserved) or "" (not specified). \
There are two ways to specifiy the type of QOS\: \
- With a value such as "tos 22" \
- With one of the following strings\: "servicetype best", "servicetype controlled", "servicetype guaranteed", "servicetype qualitative" \
The default for audio is "servicetype guaranteed" \
If QOS is not supported for audio, or if you do not want to brand in a specific type, leave this setting empty.

qos.system\:qos\:signaling.label=Signaling
qos.system\:qos\:signaling.description=Specifies the type of QOS supported for signaling. If QOS is not supported for signaling, or if you do not want to brand in a specific type, leave this setting empty.

qos.system\:qos\:video.description=Specifies the type of QOS supported for video. \
There are two ways to specifiy the type of QOS\: \
- With a value such as "tos 22" \
- With one of the following strings\: "servicetype best", "servicetype controlled", "servicetype guaranteed", "servicetype qualitative" \
The default for video is "servicetype controlled" \
If QOS is not supported for video, or if you do not want to brand in a specific type, leave this setting empty.

qos.system\:vpn\:connection_name.label=VPN connection name
qos.system\:vpn\:connection_name.description=This setting is used when: \
- the application is runing in Windows on an Intel Centrino Duo mobile-technology-based laptop (this is auto detected). \
- Bandwidth has been reserved (setting system\:qos\:audio) \
- The computer has a VPN connection to a remote server. \
When these three conditions exist, entering the VPN connection name in this field ensures that the bandwidth reservation and quality of service requests are honored. \
If the setting is not completed, then whenever a phone call is placed while the the application computer has a live VPN connection, then the bandwidth reservation and quality of service requests will not be honored. \
If the application is being used in a deployment in which some users are using the specified laptop and other users are using other computers, complete this setting\: its value will be ignored for users with "other" computers. \
The VPN name can be obtained by entering an ipconfig command.

system.resources.proxies\:proxyn\:xcap_oma_auid.description=If XCAP is used for storage of resources, specifies whether XCAP conforms to SIMPLE or to the standard maintained by OMA (Open Mobile Alliance). \
Set to true if your XCAP usage conforms to OMA. The AUID in all XCAP content will be set to "org.openmobileallilance.pres-rules", and the application will compose XCAP content that complies with that standard. \
Set to false if your XCAP usage conforms to SIMPLE. The AUID in all XCAP content will be set to "pres-rules", and the application will compose XCAP content that complies with the SIMPLE standard.

system.resources.system\:contacts\:load_offline.label=Load contacts when offline
system.resources.system\:contacts\:load_offline.description=Set to true to display the contact list when the application is in offline mode (that is, even if the application could not register the default account with the SIP registrar or if the network connection is down). The user will be able to consult the list, but will not be able to make calls or IMs via the default account (although they will be able to make calls or IMs via other enabled accounts if the network is up). Keep in mind that the contact list belongs to the default account.). \
False means that if the application is in offline mode, the contact list will not be displayed.

system.resources.system\:webdav\:ignore_versioning.label=Ignore WebDAV versioning
system.resources.system\:webdav\:ignore_versioning.description=Set to true if the webDAV server does not support versioning. The default is true, because many servers do not yet support versioning. \
If you set this setting to false and contact list updates to or from the server start to fail, then you should probably change the setting back to true.
