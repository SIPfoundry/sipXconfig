                                    INSTALL

These are brief instructions on how to install sipXconfig. For more detailed
information, see this page on the SIPfoundry wiki:

    http://sipx-wiki.calivia.com/index.php/SipX_ConfigServer_Installation

For post-installation instructions, see the README file in this directory.

FULL PBX INSTALL

If you have installed the entire sipX PBX on Fedora or Redhat Enterprise LINUX
then you're done.  SipXconfig has been installed as part of the PBX.

DEPENDENCIES

Installing Java

Download j2sdk 1.4 (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html) and follow the
installation instructions on that web page. j2sdk 1.5
(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp) is also supported.  You will have
a choice between "RPM in self-extracting file" and "self-extracting
file". Choose the latter (non-RPM) because Sun's RPMs are ill-behaved.

Installing dependencies with yum (Fedora Core only)

Common to all Fedora systems, you need to add the following packages:

    yum install tftp-server httpd postgresql-server

For Redhat Enterprise:

    yum install tftp-server httpd rh-postgresql-server

Java build tools using JPackage

You can add JPackage to your yum repository as follows (see http://www.mksearch.mkdoc.org/howto/jpackage-fc3/ for more information):

    wget -P /tmp http://jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
    rpm --import /tmp/jpackage.asc
    wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d http://jpackage.org/jpackage.repo

Remove any previous ant install:

    rpm -e apache-ant

Now you can update your system to the required packages:

    yum install ant ant-nodeps junit ant-junit checkstyle checkstyle-optional\
    ant-trax jakarta-commons-beanutils jakarta-commons-collections

SipX dependencies:

* sipXportLib (http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXportLib) (same version as sipXconfig)
* sipXtackLib (http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXtack) (same version as sipXconfig)
* sipXcommserverLib (http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXcommserverLib) (same version as sipXconfig)
* sipXpbx (http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXpbx) (same version as sipXconfig)

See the next section for more information on how to download this software.

INSTALL FROM RPMS

For Fedora Core 3, and soon Fedora Core 4, you can download and install
sipXconfig RPMs from http://www.sipfoundry.org/pub/sipX/.

INSTALL FROM SOURCE

For other LINUX distributions (as well as Fedora), you can download sipXconfig
source and build the product yourself.  If you have obtained source code from
subversion and not from a tar file, then run these commands:

    autoreconf -if
    ./configure
    make all check install

Then you need to run this one command to initialize the database, once ever as root:

  su - root
  sipxconfig.sh --setup

See the above wiki page for more information.
