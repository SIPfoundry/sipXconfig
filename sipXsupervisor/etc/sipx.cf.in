# Used to find a running service by looking in process table for command name.
# NOTE: When looking for processes started by an init.d script, you'll need
# to specify the path to the binary because that usually what is listed in the
# process table, not the init.d wrapper script.
# 
# Example:
#
#  methods:
#    any::
#      "any" usebundle => find_sipxservice_by_command("/full/path/myservice","myservice_running");
#
#  commands:

# Normal process select is by regex in process list, so here's help selecting a 
# process by pid file.
#
# TODO: find a way to call more convieniently
#   - not require pidfile to exists
#   - not to have to call readfile to translate pidfile to pid in caller
#
# Example:
#
#  processes:
#     my_process_should_be_running:
#       "anyname_you_want"
#          process_select => by_pid(readfile("$(my_pidfile)", "100")),
